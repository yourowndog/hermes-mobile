## Overview

**Hermes Mobile** is a native Android app for controlling your [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) from your phone. Chat with your agent, manage cron jobs, skills, models and more.

It connects to the Hermes dashboard (REST API and WebSocket gateway), so you need a running dashboard that your phone can reach.

## Features

- **Chat:** Talk to your agent. History is stored locally in Room, and notifications support inline replies.
- **Configuration:** Manage profiles, skills, plugins, toolsets, and model/provider selections.
- **Operations:** Stream and filter live logs, manage cron jobs, edit environment keys, test webhooks, and monitor processes.
- **Gateway status:** Check the WebSocket connection, MCP servers, messaging channels, and OAuth providers.
- **Productivity:** Manage tasks on Kanban boards, track agent milestones, and browse session history.
- **Analytics and billing:** See usage analytics and manage billing or subscriptions.
- **Theming:** Seven built-in presets (Default, Monochrome, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, AMOLED, Nord, Garnet), plus Material You dynamic colors on supported devices.
- **Material 3 design:** Pull-to-refresh, a scroll-aware top bar, and customizable bottom navigation.

## Quick Start

1. Install Hermes Mobile from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.m57.hermescontrol/), or download the APK from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/Hy4ri/hermes-mobile/releases/latest).
2. Start your Hermes dashboard on a host your phone can reach.
3. Open the app, tap **Sign in**, and follow [Authentication](#authentication).

---

## Authentication

The app detects which auth mode your dashboard uses and shows only the fields you need.

> **Security:** Use HTTPS for remote connections. Plain HTTP/WS is for trusted local networks only, because authentication does not encrypt the transport.

### 1. Start the dashboard

On the host machine:

```bash
hermes dashboard                          # loopback (127.0.0.1:9119) — no auth needed
hermes dashboard --host 0.0.0.0           # LAN — requires auth
```

For LAN access, set credentials in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
dashboard:
  basic_auth:
    username: admin # pick your own
    password: hermes # pick your own
```

### 2. Connect the app

Tap **Sign in** on the landing screen and enter the dashboard host and port. The app probes the dashboard and shows the fields it needs.

**Token only** (dashboard on the same machine, bound to loopback)

- Enter the **Token**. You can find it in `~/.hermes/dashboard-token.txt` or in `~/.hermes/.env` as `HERMES_DASHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN`.
- The app can also extract the token from the dashboard page for you.

**Basic auth** (dashboard on the LAN behind a password)

- Enter your **Username** and **Password** (default `admin` / `hermes`).
- The app logs in, stores a session cookie, and requests a WebSocket ticket automatically.

### Manual HTTPS client certificates (mTLS)

Open **Connections → HTTPS mTLS client certificate configuration** from the drawer, or tap
**Connections** on the first-launch landing page before signing in. The existing
**Settings → Connection** page also links to the manager. Install client certificates
in Android settings first; the app stores aliases only, never private keys.

Each binding belongs to an HTTPS hostname and port across all paths and connection
profiles. Use **Add Configuration** or **Edit Configuration**, then **Select Certificate**
or **Change Certificate** to open Android KeyChain. A valid address, port and selected
certificate are required to **Save**. **Delete Configuration** clears the saved binding
without removing the system certificate. Cancelling the picker keeps the draft alias;
leaving an edited draft asks whether to discard unsaved changes. Host/port edits
preserve the draft certificate and invalidate pending choices.
An editor dismissed or destroyed while the picker is open ignores its late callback.

Network requests never open a certificate picker or wait for user selection. Missing,
expired, revoked or incompatible keys result in no client identity, so servers requiring
mTLS fail normally until a usable binding is saved. REST, WebSocket, images, attachments
and audio/video share the TLS configuration. Default Android server trust and hostname
verification remain enabled; no private CA or permissive trust policy is added.

Saving (including selecting the same alias again) or deleting a configuration retires live
TLS sockets and session contexts for the affected addresses. Retry failed requests or
restart media playback; content already displayed or buffered may remain visible.
Remote image memory/disk cache keys and gateway file cache keys include persistent
identity generations and a shared cache epoch covering redirect destinations, so a late old response cannot populate the new identity's cache.
While any binding exists, remote cache keys also include a per-launch epoch, because a
KeyChain change made while the app was stopped cannot be observed; cached remote content is
reused only within one app launch. Old cache entries age out under the existing cache policies. To isolate client identities,
HTTP/2 connection coalescing across origins is disabled for the shared clients, including
unbound origins; HTTP/2 within one origin remains enabled. A binding change also changes
cache keys for unrelated remote resources because their redirect destinations are unknown
before fetching. Redirects select the destination origin's saved identity only.

### Cloudflare Access and custom headers

1. Enter your dashboard's HTTPS URL on the login screen.
2. Tap **Custom headers**, then **Add Cloudflare headers**.
3. Enter your service token's `CF-Access-Client-Id` and `CF-Access-Client-Secret` values.
4. Tap **Save**. The app probes the dashboard again, then shows the Hermes login fields.

Your [Cloudflare Access policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/)
must accept the service token. These headers authenticate with Cloudflare; you still
need to complete Hermes authentication.

**Other headers.** You can add any custom header name and value in the same editor.
To edit or remove saved headers, open **Custom headers** from login, or from the saved
connection's edit dialog in Settings. Values are masked and stored in encrypted
preferences. Saving an empty list removes the headers for that URL.

**Where headers are sent.**

- Profiles with the same server URL share headers.
- They apply to probes, login, API and media requests, and WebSocket handshakes.
- Each URL's scheme, host, port, and path prefix limit where its headers go.
- Redirects outside that scope do not receive them, and WebSocket redirects are not followed.
- The app manages `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and transport headers itself.

### Connection profiles

Have multiple gateways? Switch between them in **Settings → Connection profiles**. Each profile stores its own host, port, and token.

---

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 21+** (used for Kotlin compilation and the Gradle toolchain).
- An **Android SDK** matching the compile SDK in [`app/build.gradle.kts`](app/build.gradle.kts), from Android Studio or the **Nix** development environment. Set `ANDROID_HOME` or `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`.

### Build and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hy4ri/hermes-mobile.git
cd hermes-mobile
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

For release builds, set the keystore environment variables (`KEYSTORE_PATH`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`). Or let the GitHub Actions release workflow build on a `v*` tag push.

### Nix emulator

The Nix development shell turns on physical keyboard input in an existing `hermes_dev` AVD. It respects `ANDROID_AVD_HOME` and `ANDROID_USER_HOME`, defaulting to `~/.android/avd`. The shell does not create the AVD, so create `hermes_dev` first.

Close any running emulator, then cold boot once to apply the setting:

```bash
nix develop --command emulator -avd hermes_dev -no-snapshot-load
```

Later launches can omit `-no-snapshot-load`.
