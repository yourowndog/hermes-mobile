# Contributing to Hermes Mobile

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hermes Mobile! To maintain high code quality and consistency, we ask all contributors to follow the workflow and guidelines outlined below.

---

## Before You Start: Search First

A quick duplicate check saves your time and keeps the PR queue clean:

```bash
gh search prs --repo Hy4ri/hermes-mobile --state open "<your feature>"
gh search prs --repo Hy4ri/hermes-mobile --state closed "<your feature>"
gh search issues --repo Hy4ri/hermes-mobile --state open "<your feature>"
```

If an open PR already covers it, review or improve that one instead of opening a competing duplicate. For larger work, comment on the issue to signal you're on it.

## PR Workflow

Every change must go through a pull request (PR) targeting the `dev` staging branch. Do not push directly to `main` or `dev`.

**Keep PRs focused: one feature or one fix per PR.** Unrelated changes belong in separate PRs so each one stays easy to review, test, and revert.

1. **Pick or open an issue** to discuss the changes you want to make.
2. **Create a branch** off `dev` using the following naming convention:
   - Features: `feat/short-description` (optionally `feat/issue-N-description`)
   - Bug fixes: `fix/short-description` (optionally `fix/issue-N-description`)
   - CI/chore: `ci/...`, `chore/...`
3. **Implement your changes** and format them locally (see Code Style).
4. **Submit a PR** targeting the `dev` branch, filling the PR template.
5. **Ensure all CI checks pass** (ktlint, Android Lint, unit tests, build).
6. **Rebase onto `dev` before merge.** Run `git fetch origin dev && git rebase origin/dev`, resolve conflicts carefully, and re-run verification on the rebased result. Maintainers squash-merge; green CI does not by itself authorize a merge.

## Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep the history scannable:

- `feat:` — New feature for the user
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `refactor:` — Code change with no functional change
- `docs:` — Documentation only
- `test:` — Adding or fixing tests
- `ci:` — CI configuration or scripts
- `chore:` — Maintenance, deps, tooling

Keep commits **atomic**: one subject line (≤72 chars) + max 2 lines of body. If it needs more, split into multiple commits.

```
fix(#431): resume last session from Room cache on cold start

Shows cached messages before WS connects and resumes the last
session on GatewayReady instead of creating a blank one.
```

## AI Tool Usage

If you use AI coding tools (including agents) to contribute:

- **Never** add the AI tool as author, co-author, or `Co-Authored-By` in commit metadata.
- Direct AI agents to [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) in the repo root — `AGENTS.md` contains operational and architecture conventions, while `DESIGN.md` defines visual, interaction, and accessibility requirements and links to the token sources. Theme implementation is documented in [`THEMES.md`](app/src/main/java/com/m57/hermescontrol/theme/THEMES.md).

## Translations

Translations for Hermes Mobile are managed through [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/hermes-mobile/hermes-mobile/).

- Source strings are located in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`.
- Localized strings are stored in `app/src/main/res/values-<locale>/strings.xml`.
- You can contribute translations directly on Weblate without modifying code or opening manual PRs.

## Code Style

We enforce Kotlin coding conventions and Jetpack Compose best practices.

### Kotlin Formatting

- Code formatting is checked and enforced by **ktlint 1.8.0** in CI. The authoritative command is the Gradle task (not the standalone binary):
  ```bash
  ./gradlew ktlintCheck        # check (CI-equivalent)
  ./gradlew ktlintFormat       # auto-fix, then re-check with ktlintCheck
  ```
  > ⚠️ Hand-patching indentation/import order routinely fails the real CI gate (multiline-expression-wrapping and ASCII import order are the usual casualties). Always run `ktlintFormat`, never fix formatting by hand.
- Import ordering is strictly ASCII-lexicographic (uppercase before lowercase: e.g., `LaunchedEffect` before `collectAsState`).

### Compose Guidelines

- Standard screen structures must use `HermesScaffold` rather than raw Material3 `Scaffold`.
- Follow existing Compose APIs: required parameters first, `modifier` as the first optional parameter, then other optional parameters; keep trailing composable content last.
- Do **not** apply `paddingValues` on inner content inside `HermesScaffold` — the scaffold already handles top bar padding. See `AGENTS.md` for the full breakdown of this recurring bug.
- Every data screen must implement `LoadingState`, `ErrorState`, and `EmptyState` branches in its `when { }` block.

### Color Usage

- **No hardcoded `Color(0x...)` literals** outside `theme/`, `*Preview.kt`, and auth screens. A Gradle task (`checkColorLiterals`) enforces this in CI.
- Use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.<token>` or `LocalHermesStatusColors.current.<semantic>` instead.
- `Color.Transparent` and `Color.Unspecified` are allowed.

### Tests

- Unit tests: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` (MockK). Instrumented Compose UI tests run in CI on an emulator.
- **Tests must not touch real on-device storage.** Use `@get:Rule TemporaryFolder` (or Room `inMemoryDatabaseBuilder`) — never write to real app data or external storage. CI/emulator environments are ephemeral; leaking state breaks the next run.
- Mock time/dispatchers explicitly (`StandardTestDispatcher` + `Dispatchers.setMain`), restore `Dispatchers.Main` in teardown, and cancel test-owned scopes. Follow neighboring tests for the affected component.
- For UI changes, exercise the changed flow on a device or emulator and record the behavior observed. A built or downloaded CI APK alone is not behavioral verification. If device verification is unavailable, state that gate explicitly rather than marking it passed.


### Gateway contract snapshot

`GatewayContractTest` checks `WsMethods`, handled server requests and literal param keys against a vendored copy of
hermes-agent's `gateway-contract.openrpc.json` (`app/src/test/resources/gateway-contract/`, provenance in `SOURCE`).
It is test-only. Refresh it with `scripts/sync-gateway-contract.sh [ref]`, then run
`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests '*GatewayContract*'` and review the diff. Allowlist exceptions need a reason in
`GatewayContractAllowlist`.

---

## Dependency & Build Hygiene

- **Pin build tooling.** AGP/Kotlin/SDK versions are pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and `build.gradle.kts` on purpose. Unpinned versions silently break the build on the next dependabot/CI refresh (the "SDK not writable" AGP trap). Bump deliberately, not via wildcard ranges.
- Never add a dependency without updating the version catalog; CI validates the Gradle wrapper.

## PR Checklist

Before submitting your PR, please verify:

- [ ] I searched open/closed PRs + issues for duplicates (see *Before You Start*).
- [ ] PR is focused on one feature or one fix (no unrelated changes).
- [ ] Branch is rebased onto current `dev` (`git rebase origin/dev`).
- [ ] `./gradlew ktlintCheck` passes (ran `ktlintFormat` first — no hand edits).
- [ ] `checkColorLiterals` passes (no hardcoded Color literals outside theme/).
- [ ] `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` passes locally (or CI unit-tests job is green).
- [ ] No unused imports, unused parameters, or dead code.
- [ ] Meaningful images and icon-only actions have localized accessible labels; decorative images/icons use `contentDescription = null` to avoid redundant announcements.
- [ ] New screens use `HermesScaffold` and implement Loading/Error/Empty states.
- [ ] UI changes follow [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md), including applicable contrast, touch-target, font-scaling, and RTL requirements.
- [ ] Changed UI behavior was exercised on a device/emulator; the PR records the result or explicitly names the unverified gate.
- [ ] New components match the UI/UX style of similar existing screens.
- [ ] Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and are atomic (subject + ≤2 lines body).
