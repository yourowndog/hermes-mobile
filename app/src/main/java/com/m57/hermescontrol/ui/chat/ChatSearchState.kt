/**
 * Snapshot-backed holder for in-chat search state, owned by
 * [ChatSearchDelegate] and read directly by composables.
 *
 * Being a STABLE instance with mutable [androidx.compose.runtime.State]
 * fields — the LazyListState pattern — means search updates never change
 * the instance itself, so composables that take it as a parameter (the
 * full-bleed chat list) are SKIPPED on search changes; only the scopes
 * that actually read a field (visible item lambdas, the scroll effect)
 * recompose. That was the last big cost: search state used to live inside
 * [ChatUiState], so every debounced scan re-executed the entire list body
 * (turns loop + item registrations) on the main thread.
